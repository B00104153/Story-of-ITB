<p>The Institute is home to a large variety of plants and animals. These different habitats are spread throughtout the campus grounds and all year around there are new and familiar animals and plants that show up!<br>
The Institute of Technology is also proud to provide students with the opportunity to study Ecology. The course focuses on all different aspects. A small study carried out this year by ecology students,<br> provided answers to important questions regarding the college and it's ecology side. The study showed that 
<li>ITB has a very ecologically healthy campus</li>
<li>There are complex food webs found on the campus</li>
<li>Findings show a large variety in diversity in floral and wildlife</li>
<li>There is an enhanced soil organic matter on campus</li>
</p>

<p>Throughout the ITB campus there is a wide variety in different types of plants and habitats.<br> 
These include:
<ul>
<li>Hedgerows</li>
<li>Trees</li>
<li>Wet Lands</li>
<li>Grass</li>
<li>Scrublands</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hedgerows</strong> - There is a number of different hedgerows present on the campus, the main two type are relic hedgerows that have a number of different trees in them and managed hedgerows which are hedgerows that are man made and trimmed throught the year.<br>
<strong>Trees</strong> - The trees on campus are one of the most common type of habit that is present on campus with Ash Trees taking the number one place as the most perdominant tree type. The oldest tree on campus is estimated to be 112 years old. The trees on campus are a great indication to wildlife, mature tree roots are evidence in providing animals such as rabbits with homes.<br>
<strong>Wet Lands</strong> - Wetlands are areas of land that is saturated with water either permanently or seasonally. Wet lands support a diverse range of species and plants. They stood floodwaters, wet lands purifies water, control flows, act as carbon sinks, provide scenic views, provide food and allow a diverse range of wildlife to live there. The ITB pond acts as a flood plain for the river Tolka.<br>
<strong>Grass</strong> - Grass on campus is especially beneficail for many different reason. Tall grass acts as a cover for some animals to hide them from predators. Grass is beneficial for gazing animals (birds or cows). For every heater of grass 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide is taken in.<br>
<strong>Srublands</strong> - Srublands plays a major role in providing the plants and wildlife on campus with food and shelter.</p>
